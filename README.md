# active-learning

This is en implementation of various active learning algorithms.
Stream based unceratinity sampling and query by commitee is implemented.
Pool based uncertatinity sampling abnd QBC is also implemented.

In the unceratinity sampling, least confident, margin sampling and entropy is used.
In QBC, vote entropy and KL-divergence are used.

An implementaion of labelling based on majority of samples in clusters after K-means clustering is also implemented.

Look at REPORT.pdf for further details.
